# OSDF
Open Science Data Framework (OSDF)

OSDF is a server that is used to provide a RESTful HTTP API for storing, retrieving and modifying JSON documents.
The server supports links between documents, security with access control lists, versioning of changes, and
validation of data using JSON-Schema. This reference implementation of the API is built with Node.js, CouchDB
and ElasticSearch.
