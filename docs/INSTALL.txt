Open Science Data Framework (OSDF) Installation Overview
===============================================================================


Requirements
===============================================================================
  - Node.js 4.x or better
  - CouchDB 1.6.x running on the same machine, or available on a separate
    host
  - ElasticSearch 1.6 (or better) running on the same machine, or available
    on a separate host.
  - curl. The curl utility is a general purpose tool for http communications
    and is used for many tests and examples.

Package Installation
===============================================================================

OSDF can be installed from source with the tarball available from the OSDF
website downloads page accessible from http://osdf.igs.umaryland.edu.
However, it is recommended that users install OSDF using the pre-built .deb
package file. Packages for Ubuntu/Debian based systems are also provided from
the project's downloads page.

For package installation:

1. Download the package. If you have the wget tool available on your target
system, you can download the package like so:

  $ wget http://osdf.igs.umaryland.edu/dl/deb/osdf_0.20-1_amd64.deb

You may have to alter the version number in the above URL to match the latest
stable version that is available.

If you do NOT have wget, but have curl (most modern systems should have it
available), then try:

  $ curl -O http://osdf.igs.umaryland.edu/dl/deb/osdf_0.20-1_amd64.deb

Either way, by using wget or curl, you should end up with the OSDF .deb
file in your current working directory.

2. Install the OSDF package

As root:

  # dpkg -i osdf_0.20-1_amd64.deb

or using sudo:

  $ sudo dpkg -i osdf_0.20-1_amd64.deb

3. Verify the installation succeeded

   $ dpkg -l osdf

You should see output confirming that OSDF was installed properly:

   ii  osdf                                     0.20-1...................

Configuration
=============

1. Ensure that CouchDB has an administrative account and that the server is
secured. First, browse to CouchDB's web interface, called "Futon", at
http://localhost:5984/_utils/ (if CouchDB is running on your localhost).  You
should NOT see "Admin Party" at the lower right corner of the interface.  If
you DO see "Admin Party", you must establish an administrative account as
these credentials will be required to proceed with completing the
installation.

2. Create a CouchDB database called "osdf". This is easily accomplished via
the "Futon" web interface. Browse to your Futon's address. There should be
a "Create Database..." button near the top of the browser screen. Create a
database called "osdf".

3. Create a CouchDB account for both the OSDF application to use as well as
the ElasticSearch engine as well. OSDF provides a script to ease the creation
of CouchDB accounts under bin/couchdb/new_couch_user.sh (the exact location
may differ between systems if OSDF was installed via a package manager like
apt/dpkg or rpm). Make a note of the username and password chosen. For the
account 'role', we recommend that "osdf" be entered.

  $ bin/couchdb/new_couch_user.js

4. Create the CouchDB design documents needed by OSDF. OSDF comes bundled with
the generate_design_docs.js script in the bin/couchdb directory. Run the
script and specify the address for CouchDB, the administrative username, the
name of the database (typically "osdf"), and the CouchDB port number. The
script will also prompt you for the CouchDB administrative password but the
keystrokes will not be echoed to the screen as it is entered:

  $ bin/couchdb/generate_design_docs.js --address localhost \
    --database osdf --username COUCHDB_ADMIN --port 5984

In the example above, replace COUCHDB_ADMIN with your CouchDB server's
adminsitrative username.

5. Install the ElasticSearch river to feed off of changes from the CouchDB
server. If the both the ElasticSearch and CouchDB servers are installed on the
"localhost" with the default ports, and the CouchDB database is named "osdf",
then the curl command to install the river would be: 

$ curl -X PUT 'http://localhost:9200/_river/osdf/_meta' \
  -d '{ "type" : "couchdb",
        "couchdb" : {
            "user" : "USER",
            "password" : "PASSWD",
            "host" : "localhost",
            "port" : 5984,
            "db" : "osdf",
            "filter" : null,
            "ignore_attachments": true
        },
        "index" : {
            "index" : "osdf",
            "type" : "osdf",
            "bulk_size" : "100",
            "bulk_timeout" : "10ms"
        } }'

Ensure you use the CouchDB username and password that you created in step #3
instead of the literal "USER" and "PASSWD" seen in the example command
above.
